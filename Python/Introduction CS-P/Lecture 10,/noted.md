* Linear complexity - procedure happens n times,,
* logarithmic complexity - the number of times that the procedure happens is reduced by a constant number
* log-linear complexity - 
* polynomial - commonly happens when there are nested loops/recursivecalls
* Exponential - recursive functions where more than one recursive call for each size of problem
