    "* an abstract data type is a set of objects and the operations on those objects.

    "* The specifications of those operations define an interafce between the abstract data type and the rest of the program. The interface defines the behavior of the operations - what they do, but not how they do it. the interface thus progvides an abstraction barrier that isolates the rest of the program from the data structuers, algorithms, and code involved in providing a realization of the type abstraction.\n",
